    <abstract>
      <t>Software applications typically generate a large amount of log data in the course of their operation in order to help with monitoring, troubleshooting, etc. However, like all data generated and operated upon by software systems, logs can contain information sensitive to users. Personal data identification and anonymization in logs is thus crucial to ensure that no personal data is being inadvertently logged and retained which would make the logging application run afoul of laws around storing private information. 
This document focuses on exploring mechanisms to specify personal or sensitive data in logs, to enable any server collecting, processing or analyzing logs to identify personal data and thereafter, potentially enforce any redaction.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Personal data identification and redaction is crucial to make sure
      that a logging application is not storing and potentially leaking
      users&rsquo; private information. There are known precedents that help
      discover and extract sensitive data, for example, we can define a
      regular expression or lookup rules that will match a person's name,
      credit card number, email address and so on. Besides, there are data
      dictionary and datasets based training models that can predict the
      presence of sensitive data. In most cases, however, what data is
      considered personal and sensitive is often subjective, provisional and
      contextual to the data source or the application processing the data,
      which makes it hard to use automated techniques to identify personal
      data. The challenges are summarized as follows: </t>

      <t>- What comprises personal data is often subjective and use case
      specific. </t>

      <t>- There are many disparate set of personal data types and often
      require multitude approaches for its detection. </t>

      <t>- There are no standards that govern formats of sensitive data making
      automation difficult for most common use cases. </t>

      <t>Once the personal information is identified, it has to be
      appropriately tagged. Personal data tagging is especially important in
      cases where log data is flowing in from disparate sources. In cases
      where tagging at source is not possible (e.g. log data generated by a
      legacy IoT device, Web server or a Firewall), a centralized logging
      server can be tasked with making sure the log data is tagged before
      passing on downstream. Once the logs are tagged, the logging application
      can use anonymization techniques to redact the fields appropriately.
      This document focuses on the tagging aspect of log redaction. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>Personal data: <xref
      target="RFC6973">RFC 6973</xref> defines personal data as "any information
      relating to an individual who can be identified, directly or
      indirectly.&rdquo; This typically includes information such as IP
      addresses, username. However, the definition of personal data varies
      heavily by what other information is available, the jurisdiction of
      operation and other such factors. Hence, this document does not focus on
      prescriptively listing what log fields contain personal data but rather
      on what a tagging mechanism would look like once a logging application
      has determined which fields it considers to hold personal data. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation and Use Cases ">
      <t>Most systems like network devices, web servers and application
      services record information about user activity, transactions, network
      flows, etc., as log data. Logs are incredibly useful for various
      purposes such as security monitoring, application debugging and
      opertional maintenace. In addition, there are use cases of organizations
      exporting or sharing logs with third party log analyzers for purposes of
      security incident reponse, monitoring, business analytics, where logs
      can be valuable source of information. In such cases, there are concerns
      about potential exposure of personal data to unintented systems or
      receipients. This document explores techiques for tagging logs to aid
      identification of personal data.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Techniques">
      <t>Once personal information data is identified via manual detection,
      dictionary or dataset based training models, the log imposed with tag
      information either at field-level or the log-level.</t>

      <t>This is an example of a log message in <xref
      target="RFC3164">RFC 3164</xref> format. We can
      imagine that a logging application determines that user_name, err_user
      and ip_addr are fields that can contain sensitive personal data.</t>

      <section title="Field Level Tagging">
        <t>In the field-level tagging method, the identifed &lt;attribute,
        value&gt;field is tagged with a "pii_data=true" attribute specifying
        the field to be sensitive or personal. In case of log-level tagging
        approach, the data about fields that are personal is specified using
        "pii_name" attribute that contains list of one or more field deemed
        sensitive or personal.</t>

        <t>This log can be transformed as following using 'Field-level'
        tagging techique:</t>
